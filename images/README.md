# üì∏ Images Folder

Welcome to the **Images** folder of the Laravel Tips repository! This folder houses all the visual assets that complement our Laravel tips and tutorials. By keeping images organized here, we ensure that our documentation is clear, engaging, and easy to follow.

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure

We follow a structured approach to organizing images:

- **Route Caching Diagrams:**  
  Visual representations for tips related to route caching (e.g., `route-caching.png`).

- **Performance Benchmarks:**  
  Graphs and charts that illustrate performance improvements.

- **Code Flowcharts:**  
  Diagrams explaining application architecture or specific code workflows.

*Feel free to add sub-folders if the number of images grows significantly to maintain clarity and organization.*

## üé® Image Guidelines

To maintain consistency and high quality across our documentation, please adhere to the following guidelines when adding or updating images:

- **Format:**  
  Use common image formats such as `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.svg`. PNG is preferred for diagrams and screenshots for its clarity.

- **Naming Conventions:**  
  Use descriptive names (e.g., `route-caching.png`, `query-builder-flowchart.jpg`). This makes it easier to identify images and reference them in documentation.

- **Resolution:**  
  Ensure images are of high resolution for clear display on all devices. Aim for a balance between quality and file size for optimal loading speeds.

- **Consistency:**  
  Use a consistent color scheme and design style that matches the overall branding of the repository.

## üîó How to Reference These Images

When linking images in your Markdown documentation (e.g., in tip files), use relative paths. For example:

```markdown
![Route Caching Diagram](./images/route-caching.png)
```

This ensures that the images load correctly regardless of where the repository is viewed.

## üìà Best Practices

- **Update Regularly:**  
  If a tip is updated with new visuals, replace the corresponding image here to keep the documentation up-to-date.

- **Optimized Files:**  
  Optimize images for the web using tools like [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) or [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to reduce file size without compromising quality.

- **Credit & Sources:**  
  If you use third-party images or graphics, please include a comment or a small text file noting the source and any required attribution.
